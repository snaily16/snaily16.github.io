Hello! My name is Snehal, I'm a software developer currently working at **Halliburton**, with a strong passion for coding and creating innovative solutions. With a diverse background and experience in various projects, I am excited to share my journey with you.

I started my journey in the field of Computer Science by completing my B.Tech in CSE from DBATU Lonere. This solid foundation equipped me with a strong understanding of programming concepts and laid the groundwork for my future endeavors. 
Continuing my pursuit of knowledge, I completed my M.Tech in CSE from MNIT Jaipur, where I was awarded a `Gold Medal` for my outstanding academic performance. During my M.Tech, I had the opportunity to work on a deep learning project - `"Face Aging with Style Transfer"`, sponsored by MeitY, Gov. of India. This project allowed me to explore the fascinating world of deep learning, generative models and develop skills in using Machine learning libraries and frameworks like `PyTorch`, `Numpy`, `Matplotlib`, etc.

The world of coding fascinates me, and I find joy in crafting creative and efficient soltions to complex problems. Throughout my academic journey and professional experience, I have had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, tacling challenges across various domains. This has further fueled my passion for coding, as I constantly seek to expand my knowledge and push the boundaries of what is possible. 

Programming languages are the tools of my trade, and I am well-versed in languages like `C`, `C++`, and `Python`. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge by diving into Java, embracing the opportunity to add another powerful language to my skill set

The idea of open source has always fascinated me. Linux has been my preferred operating system for the past five years. I enjoy exploring its features and discovering new ways to optimize my workflow.

Learning is a lifelong journey, and I strive to learn something new every day. I believe in staying curious and embracing new challenges.

Happy coding!
