        institution: CVIP, IIT Jammu
        year: 2023
        description:
            - This work proposes a multi-scale target age-based style face ageing model using an encoder-decoder architecture to generate high-fidelity face images under ageing
            - Proposed using skip connections with selective transfer units (STU) to select and modify the encoder feature and
used style information gathered from a random image of the target age group to train the generator.
